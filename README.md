## introduction
With social media becoming ubiquitous, information consumption from this media has also increased.However, this increased reliance on social media has also
given rise to a significant challenge: the proliferation of misinformation, commonly referred to as ”fake news.” This issue is not merely a matter of inconvenience; it poses serious threats to various critical aspects of society, including
the economy, democracy, public health, and safety. Therefore, the identification
and mitigation of fake news have become essential tasks that demand urgent
attention and innovative solutions.
In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the detection and
combat of fake news have become focal points of research, leveraging a diverse
array of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Recent
advancements in this field have seen the emergence of various models, including
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU), hybrid
models combining CNN with two types of text-representation models—contextfree and context-aware, and advanced pre-trained transformer-based models
such as BERTbase and RoBERTabase.
Recent studies by Alghamdi et al.[1] by conducting a benchmark study using a wide range of classical ML algorithms and Deep Learning transformerbased models. They have highlighted the remarkable capabilities of advanced
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in achieving state-of-the-art performance across numerous NLP tasks. Specifically, in the context of fake news
detection using the FakeNewsNet dataset, BERTbase and RoBERTabase
demonstrated exceptional F1 scores of 0.9241 and 0.9085, respectively, for both
PolitiFact and GossipCop news. Notably, BERTbase alone achieved accuracy
results that were comparable to the best-performing models, underscoring its
effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from short text samples. The
findings also emphasized the superior ability of transformer-based models to
handle noisy and sparse datasets, which are common characteristics of realworld fake news data.
